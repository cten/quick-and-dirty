# quick-and-dirty


For this to work you need your credentials setup properly in your .aws/credentials file.

You must have 'boto3' installed in your python environment. (pip install boto3)
This was written and tested with Python 2.7, so it may or may not work with other versions.

As the name suggests this is a very quick and simple solution, this isn't meant for use outside of the defined instructions.

To run just execute the quickanddirty.py python script and wait for the URL to be printed. 
Copy and paste the URL into your browser (you may have to wait a minute for the EC2 instance to finishing coming up).
